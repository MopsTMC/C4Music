## C4Discs

This C4Music addon fixes music disc 11, returns Cat's long-lost sequel to the game and gives a fresh feel to the rest of the records. It includes songs from Minecraft's documentary score, [One](https://c418.org/albums/one/), and the 2008 unreleased game project, [Circle](https://c418.org/albums/circle/), which is thought to have inspired the Minecraft albums.
