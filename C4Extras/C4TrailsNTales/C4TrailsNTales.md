## C4Music 23w17a+ Compatibility Resource Pack

### Confirmed bug:
_There has been an oversight in the forest and flower forest biomes' sound events. Music in those biomes will not play correctly_

This is an addon resource pack for C4Music to be used with snapshot 23w17a and greater which introduces the [Minecraft: Trails & Tales](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mSphMxX1XVzllplrh-R7MS9cEohpprpgA) soundtrack. <br>

To use it, **place it above the normal C4Music pack** on your resource pack list. <br>

Currently it only mimics C4Music's globalization as in the 2.x releases, only changing the new values in `sounds.json`. Therefore, there is no reason to upload a full version of the pack as things might change during 1.20's and C4Music's development. <br>

 <p>

   - The `badlands`, `bamboo_jungle`, `cherry_grove`, `desert`, `jungle` and  `sparse_jungle` events added in 23w17a inherit from the common `music.game` sound event
   - The Relic music disc has not been changed

 </p>
</details>

## This resource pack will do nothing on older versions of Minecraft and does not work as intended without C4Music

If used without C4Music, the overworld tracklist will be the same as Vanilla 1.19 releases with added "A Familiar Room" so I guess it serves a double purpose
