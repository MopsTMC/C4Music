## C4Music Nether Addon Resource Pack

This is an addon resource pack for C4Music which replaces the Nether Update's music based [on this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/C418/comments/sro5ix/comment/jicc1cj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). <br>

### Changes

- Chrysopoeia -> [Geklimper - 2/oldgarbage.zip](https://web.archive.org/web/20101120170236/http://c418.org/archives/87)

- Rubedo -> [Texture Prayers - Dief](https://c418.bandcamp.com/track/texture-prayers)

- So Below -> [Home - Excursions](https://c418.bandcamp.com/track/home)

- Pigstep -> [Vlem - Seven Years of Server Data](https://c418.bandcamp.com/track/vlem)

To use it, **place it above the normal C4Music pack** on your resource pack list. <br>
